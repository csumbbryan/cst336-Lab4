    Jupiter is the fifth planet, but also the first of the Gas Giants. It lives as the largest planets in the Solar System, and is so massive that it causes the Sun to wobble as it orbits. In fact, it's the major contributor to the Sun occassionally not siting at the orbital center of its own Solar System!

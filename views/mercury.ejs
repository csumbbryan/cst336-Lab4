Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and such is extremely hot! However, this high temperature is only on the side facing the Sun, as Mercury is almost tidally locked. A single Mercury day takes almost a full six Earth months! As a fun factoid for physics geeks, Mercury's odd orbit wasn't able to be explained until Einstein came along with his Theory of General Relativity. An early success for General Relativity!

While there are no martians on Mars (at least that we've found), Mars is another candidate for a planet that may have supported life at one time. Mars is the fourth planet in the solar system, and is about 1/3 the size of Earth. It also does not have a magnetic field, which means its atmosphere was sadly stripped away to its very thin current version. The good news is Mars storms don't pack that much of a punch, but the bad news is there wouldn't be enough atmosphere to breathe! This hasn't stopped many from wanting to terraform Mars, essentially turning it into a hapitable planet, like Earth.

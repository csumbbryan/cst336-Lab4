Venus is the second planet in the Solar System, and one that demonstrates what happens when greenhouse gases run amok. While very similar in size to Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that would destroy any life found on Earth! In fact, due to this rather intense atmosphere, the temperature on Venus is actually higher than on Mercury's sunward side. Not a place to take a vacation, that's for sure!

Neptune is the eigth and last planet of the Solar System, with most of its orbit resides in front of Pluto's, the now dwarf planet which recently lost its planethood status. Neptune is too far away to be viewed without a telescope. Its appearance was thought to be deep blue, but recent imagery has confirmed its coloring to be closer to the muted tones of Uranus. With its distance from the Sun, one may think it's the coldest planet in the Solar System. While Neptune is very chilly, Uranus actually registers a lower average temperature!

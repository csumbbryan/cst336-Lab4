Uranus sits as the seventh planet in the Solar System, and is the first of the two ice giants. In this case, "ice" doesn't mean water ice, but a near icy state of Uranus' gases. The planet also has a very unique planetary rotation, with its poles essentially facing the Sun. Uranus also has rings, though its rings are far smaller and fainter than Saturn's.

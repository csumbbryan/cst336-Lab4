Earth is our home, and so far, the only planet in the Universe we know to definitively support life. As the third planet from the Sun, Earth sits in a perfect zone, where liquid water forms routinely. It also maintains a magnetosphere, which generously deflects harmful high-energy particiles from solar wind and solar flares. Between ideal temperatures, a magnetoshpere, an ozone layer, and many other key attributes, Earth stands out as an oasis among a very hostile environment.
